# SCT_ML_4
This code builds a hand gesture recognition model using a CNN. It extracts and preprocesses image data from a dataset, encodes gesture labels, splits the data into training and validation sets, and trains the model. The model classifies hand gestures, evaluates accuracy, and makes predictions on new images.
